        <h1>Travel to <em>Kazakhstan</em></h1>

        <p id="intro-kazakhstan">
            The world's <strong>ninth-biggest</strong> country is the most economically advanced of the <em>‘stans’</em>, thanks 
            to its abundant reserves of oil and most other valuable minerals. That money has transformed 
            the capital Nur-Sultan, on the windswept northern steppe, into a 21st-century showpiece with 
            a profusion of bold futuristic architecture. Travelers will find some fantastic restaurants 
            and accommodation amongst the leafy avenues of Almaty too; its biggest city also boasts the 
            chic ALZhiR Museum-Memorial Complex, glossy shopping centres and hedonistic nightlife. 
            But it's beyond the cities that you'll find the greatest travel adventures, whether hiking in 
            the high mountains and green valleys of the <strong>Tian Shan</strong>, searching for wildlife on
            the lake-dotted steppe, enjoying homespun hospitality in village guesthouses, or jolting across the 
            western deserts to remote underground mosques.
