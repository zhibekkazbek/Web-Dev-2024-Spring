            <strong>Step 1:</strong> Boil water in a pot over medium-high heat.<br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> Once the water is boiling, carefully add the instant ramen noodles to the pot. 
            Separate the noodles as they soften with a fork or chopsticks.<br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> While the noodles are cooking, you can prepare the eggs. 
            You can either soft boil them or hard boil them, depending on your preference. 
            To soft boil, carefully add eggs to the boiling water and cook for about 4-5 minutes. 
            For hard-boiled eggs, cook for about 7-8 minutes. Once cooked, remove the eggs from the boiling water 
            and place them in a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process. Peel the eggs once they are cool 
            enough to handle and set them aside.<br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong> Add the sliced vegetables to the pot with the noodles. 
            Let them cook for a couple of minutes until they are tender but still crisp.<br>
            <strong>Step 5:</strong> Stir in the soy sauce and sesame oil (if using) into the pot. Season with salt and pepper to taste.<br>
            <strong>Step 6:</strong> Once the noodles are cooked and the vegetables are tender, remove the pot from the heat.<br>
            <strong>Step 7:</strong> Divide the ramen noodles and vegetables into serving bowls. Pour the broth over the noodles and vegetables.<br>
            <strong>Step 8:</strong> Slice the boiled eggs in half and place them on top of the ramen.<br>
            <strong>Step 9:</strong> Garnish with any additional toppings you like, such as sliced green onions, cooked chicken, 
            tofu, seaweed, or corn.<br>
            <strong>Step 10:</strong> Serve the ramen hot and enjoy!<br>

            <strong>Step 1:</strong> Rinse the sushi rice in a fine-mesh sieve under cold water until the water runs clear.
            This helps remove excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky.<br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> Combine the rinsed rice and water in a rice cooker or pot. 
            Cook the rice according to the manufacturer's instructions for your rice cooker, or bring the water 
            to a boil in a pot, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes until the 
            rice is tender and cooked through.<br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the rice is cooked, let it sit covered for an additional 
            10 minutes to steam and absorb any remaining moisture.<br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong> While the rice is still warm, transfer it to a large mixing bowl and season with a pinch of salt, 
            mixing gently to distribute the salt evenly throughout the rice. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.<br>
            <strong>Step 5:</strong> If you're using fillings, prepare them by chopping or shredding them into small pieces.<br>
            <strong>Step 6:</strong> Wet your hands with water to prevent the rice from sticking, 
            then scoop about 1/2 cup of cooked rice into the palm of your hand.<br>
            <strong>Step 7:</strong> Flatten the rice in your palm to form a small oval or triangular shape.<br>
            <strong>Step 8:</strong> Place a small amount of your desired filling in the center of the rice.<br>
            <strong>Step 9:</strong> Gently cup your hand to enclose the filling and shape the rice into a ball or triangle, 
            pressing firmly to compact the rice and seal the filling inside.<br>
            <strong>Step 10:</strong> Continue shaping the remaining rice and fillings into onigiri.<br>
            <strong>Step 11:</strong> If desired, wrap each onigiri in a strip of nori (seaweed) to help hold its shape and add flavor. 
            You can also leave them plain if you prefer.<br>
            <strong>Step 12:</strong> Serve the onigiri immediately, or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one day.<br>

            <strong>Step 1:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 cups of whole wheat flour, 
            1 packet of active dry yeast, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of honey or maple syrup, 
            and 1 cup of warm water (about 110째F or 45째C). Mix until a dough forms.<br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.
            Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour until doubled in size.<br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> While the dough is rising, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
            Add 1/2 cup diced onions, 1/2 cup diced bell peppers, and cook for 3-4 minutes until softened.
            Stir in 2 cloves of minced garlic, cooked and shredded chicken breasts, chopped hard-boiled eggs, 
            1 teaspoon of dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 2-3 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly.<br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C).
            Lightly grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.<br>
            <strong>Step 5:</strong> Once the dough has risen, punch it down and transfer it to a lightly floured surface.
            Roll out the dough into a large rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.
            Spread the chicken and egg filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.<br>
            <strong>Step 6:</strong> Starting from one long edge, tightly roll up the dough into a log shape, pinching the seams to seal.
            Carefully transfer the rolled dough onto the prepared baking sheet, seam side down.<br>
            <strong>Step 7:</strong> Using a sharp knife, make several diagonal slashes across the top of the dough.
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes until golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
            Remove from the oven, let it cool slightly, then slice and serve.<br>
